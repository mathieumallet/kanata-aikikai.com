Yates Sensei received his dan rankings up to 3rd dan from Yamada Sensei, founder of the New York Aikikai and the United States Aikido Federation, and his 4th and 5th dan rankings from Kawahara Shihan, former Technical Director of the CAF. Yates Sensei was given the title of CAF Shidoin by Kawahara Sensei in 2008.
